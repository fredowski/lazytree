# General Information

This is lazytree which is based on GTK+ GtkTreeView ideas but with
lazy data retrieval. This is useful for a large number of columns and
rows. It provides an example lazystore which provides the
GtkTreeModel Interface without actually storing data.

Unlike GtkTreeView the columns are computed from the data model such
that all data in the data model is rendered.

lazytreeview renders the data in a lazy manner. Unlike GtkTreeView
LazyTreeView only retrieves the subset of the data from the model
which is required for viewing. This comes with restrictions.

* All cells are rendered with gtk_cell_renderer_text
* All data in the model is provided as string
