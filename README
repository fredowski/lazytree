# General Information

This is lazytree which is based on GTK+ GtkTreeView ideas for lazy
data retrieval. This is useful for a large number of columns and
rows. It provides an example lazystore which provides the
GtkTreeModel Interface without actually storing data.

lazytreeview is derived from renders the data
in a lazy manner. Unlike GtkTreeView LazyTreeView only retrieves
a subset of the data from the model. This comes with restrictions.

* All columns have the cellrenderer with type G_TYPE_STRING
* All data in the model is provided as string
